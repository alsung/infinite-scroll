# Infinity Scroll
JS Web Project Infinity Scroll

## About
The goal of this project is to implement the infinity scroll functionality seen on many social media applications as a user scrolls towards the bottom of the page, another network request is made, before the user reaches the bottom, so you don't see it and it feels as if you're seamlessly scrolling forever. The images we are using for our project are from the Unsplash API, and we track the moment all the images are loaded in order to dynamically hide our loading animation. 

This application displays one long column of images with a margin on the left and right. As a user continues scrolling towards the bottom of the page, we should expect to see the scroll bar on the side jump up as you reach the bottom of the page, signifying another network request has been made. When hovering over an image, we can see the description of the image provided by Unsplash. When an image is clicked on, you will be taken directly to the image on the Unsplash website. Here, you will see all information about the image, the author, and you are presented with the option to download the photo if desired. 

The infinity scroll application created will be mobile responsive as well, narrowing the margins to allow for a better mobile experience.
